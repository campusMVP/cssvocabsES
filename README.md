# cssvocabsES
CSS vocabulary &amp; HTML vocabulary in different languages, based on https://github.com/sakamies/vocabs (no longer available). 

**Now available here (in Spanish)** â†’ https://campusmvp.github.io/cssvocabsES/

This is just the rendered version in Spanish, for education purposes. It's rendered from the dynamic PHP version available in the original repository, in order not having to use a server for it (just client-side code).
